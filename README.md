This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique. The primary objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior and other relevant features to enable targeted marketing strategies. By analyzing customer data such as frequency of purchases, monetary value, and recency, the K-Means algorithm groups customers into meaningful segmentsâ€”such as loyal, at-risk, new, or seasonal buyers. These insights help businesses tailor their promotional efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model implementation, visualization of cluster results, and personalized offer recommendations for each segment. This analysis demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in customer relationship management and business intelligence.
